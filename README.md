Deliverable 2 ReadMe
<br/>
In this deliverable,  We create the monk up of css and html file , 
including the main page, menu bars, login, about me page, and 
some basic javascript function. This ReadMe is to illustrate the icon 
font we used in the deliverable.
For color, we used the build in color method to use color on our website
color:#F00
border-top-color:#000

For font, we use the
font-family:"Times New Roman";
font-style:italic;
font-weight: bold;

For the image, we use the 
background:url(LightNovalLibrary/Concordia-Webster.jpg)
to achieve the functionality of implementing images into our website

I use the icon found in google image, which is download into the local file and referenced into the website

We also Design to work on the personal page and upload page but that part is not yet done, which we intended to build with the back end together, so that we can build both the login and upload backend function and for now, the page is not yet done.

Deliverable 3 new function and pages:  
In deliverable 3, I added the register pages and the personal profile pages into the library.  
The backend was php where the web server I choose is apache and I used the wamp server for convient.  
The database I use is mysql with phpmyadmin gui  
Upon in the mainpage, where clicking the "personal page" button, It will redirect you to the personal page so that user can edit their personal informations.  
Upon in the register page, the user can register and create account regularly now and can log into the library.
