 Deliverable 2 ReadMe

    In this deliverable,  We create the monk up of css and html file , including the main page, menu bars, login, about me page, and some basic javascript function. This ReadMe is to illustrate the icon font we used in the deliverable.

For color, we used the build in color method to use color on our website
color:#F00
border-top-color:#000

For font, we use the
font-family:"Times New Roman";
font-style:italic;
font-weight: bold;

For the image, we use the 
background:url(LightNovalLibrary/Concordia-Webster.jpg)
to achieve the functionality of implementing images into our website

I use the icon found in google image, which is download into the local file and referenced into the website

We also Design to work on the personal page and upload page but that part is not yet done, which we intended to build with the back end together, so that we can build both the login and upload backend function and for now, the page is not yet done.
